MedicalParse
Inspiration

The genesis of MedicalParse was born out of personal experiences that hit close to home for two of our team members. They witnessed firsthand the hurdles their significant others and family members encountered in securing precise medical diagnoses. Driven by these challenges, our team was motivated to devise a solution capable of furnishing users with an expansive array of potential diagnoses based on their inputted symptoms. This initiative harnesses the esteemed health data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and incorporates the cutting-edge AI capabilities provided by OpenAI.

What it does

MedicalParse empowers users to input their symptoms into a search box and, in return, presents a list of 30 potential diseases that correlate with the entered symptoms. Our decision to display multiple possible diagnoses stems from our personal experiences with misdiagnoses, underscoring the need for a broader perspective in medical assessment.

How We Built It

Our team divided and conquered to bring MedicalParse to life. Eyas and Jalen took the helm of the front-end user interface and the integration with Flask, while Josh and Jared spearheaded the backend development, weaving in API's, harnessing datasets, and employing TensorFlow to process and analyze the data.

Challenges We Faced

Our journey was not without its hurdles. Integrating Python code into our web infrastructure proved to be a formidable challenge, which we eventually overcame through the adoption of Flaskâ€”though not without a six-hour marathon of troubleshooting. We also grappled with incorporating animations into our UI and embarked on a painstaking quest to find a dataset that met our precise needs.

What's Next for MedicalParse

Looking ahead, we envision a bright future for MedicalParse. Our roadmap includes a comprehensive overhaul of the user interface to enhance the user experience, the integration of more advanced generative AI features, and the expansion of our platform to a virtual server environment. We are committed to continuously improving MedicalParse, making it an even more valuable resource for individuals seeking medical insights.
